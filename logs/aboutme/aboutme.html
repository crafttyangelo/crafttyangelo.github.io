    <p style="text-indent: 20px;">I am currently 18 years old, very excited for the next step in life, very tired of the monotony of school. Senioritis has hit me hard for the past couple of months, especially with all my siblings telling me how much better college is. I have two sisters, Trixia and Angel. One brother, Christian. Trixia is 27, Angel is 23, and Christian is 26.</p></div>

    <p style="text-indent: 20px;">I have been into computers and technology really in general for as long as I can remember. The earliest memory I have with technology is having one of those massive monitors with the hump in the back with a ginormous pc nestled under the desk. It was Christmas so I was posed in front of the christmas tree that just so happened to be next to our family computer. I had to have been around 5-6 years old at that point. I'm planning on majoring in a Bachelors degree in science, Information Technology and Telecommunications as said on the homepage.</p>

    <p>A favorite quote of mine that I have been living by for a year or two now is this, <blockquote>"Nothing is as important as passion. No matter what you want to do with your life, be passionate."<br><cite> - Jon Bon Jovie</cite></blockquote></p>

    <footer>Speaking of quotes, here's a separate page of some of my favorite quotes of all time. Something about being able to express your goals, morals, hopes, dreams, and ethics with a short statement in a quote format is nice.</footer>
